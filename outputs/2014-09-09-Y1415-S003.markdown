Model-Driven Engineering, in our case applied to embedded and cyber-physical system modeling, is key to the definition of modern design process in these areas.
During the design process, there is usually not a single central model but rather a collection of models, possibly in different languages. These models must be coordinated to represent the whole system and this coordination usually relies on two kinds of relations, one (vertical) of functional and architectural refinement, another (horizontal) of allocation/deployment of the software model onto an execution platform model.
While individual models, either behavioral/functional or structural/architectural, are nowadays quite well established, their semantics is usually implicit, leading to difficulty in the understanding of the exact nature of the relations. Understanding the semantics and the impact of relations between individual heterogeneous models is still at infancy but it may play several roles:
  - design subdivision, or conversely integration;
  - requirement propagation across subsystems;
  - multi-view modeling with extra-functional costs and contextual physical law constraints
  - ...
Such relation links are seldom formalized in current methodologies and prevalent design environments, although there are scattered research proposals, each covering only a slight aspect of the issue (as in SysML, parametrics models or MARTE allocation to mention a case related to our activities inside our team). The topic of the PhD thesis will thus be to shape up and formalize the use of relation links model, adorned with proper extra-functional and requirement-based information, for inclusion into a formal MDE approach.

The internship is proposed in the context of the forthcoming Clarity French collaborative project, which sets itself goals along these lines. It will therefore be conducted in close contact with major French user companies and MDE software vendors for the engineering and applicative aspects, as well as academic research groups for the firm theoretical foundations. Work may start as early as October 1st, depending on motivated and competent candidates.
