Design and implementation of suitable OWASP-top ten information flow policies for  the Flowfox secure browser.

A modern browser acts more or less like an operating system, executing programs (or called scripts in the web context) sent from various web sites or stakeholders, while offering a powerful API to these scripts. Because of this API, purely static web pages have evolved from purely static web pages to full-blown web application that dynamically render interactive content. The overall conclusion is that the web is a very influential application platform whereby the technological complexity makes it vulnerable in many ways.

Despite several baked-in countermeasures within your browser, many important attacks remain possible:

Scripts are an important enabler to exploit low-level vulnerabilities within the browser.
Scripts can leak a fair amount of, privacy-sensitive information, such as your browsing history.
Scripts can fingerprint your browser to enable tracking your browser as you are surfing the web.
FlowFox is a fully functional web browser that implements a precise and general information flow control mechanism for web scripts based on the technique of secure multi-execution. 

The goal of this PFE is to perform a scientific study of the limits of FlowFox in enforcing the most popular web vulnerabilities listed in OWASP top 10. 



More precisely, the PFE has five stages: 

1) Study of information flow policies [3][4]

2) Flowfox Learning phase [1]

3) Proposal of OWASP [2] encoding using information flow policies 

4) Implementation of policies in FlowFox 

5) Pen Testing 

Having taken the CASPAR course on Web Application Security is required for this PFE.
