This project aims at developing a securely communicating video camera, also acting as a tamper-proof blackbox archiving video rushes from the nearby environment of a vehicle, as well as a sensor for navigation purposes.

#### Compétences Requises
- C/C++ programming
- system programming, threads
- If possible, knowledge in GPU programming


#### Besoins Clients
This project aims at prototyping GPU based cryptography in a very constrained environment and in the longer term developing software libraries for generalizing such solutions.

#### Résultats Attendus
- state of the art about GPU based cryptography programming
- prototype of connected camera software for Raspberry Pi
- performance benchmarks
